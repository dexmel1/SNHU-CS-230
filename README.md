### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client looking to expand their application "Draw It or Lose It." A game where players take attempt to guess pictures as they are slowly loaded on a screen. When they reached out, the game was only available as an Android app, and they were looking to expand to a cross-platform web-based application.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Based on my previous experience, building out the requirements documentation went very smoothly. I was able to translate what the client was asking for and format it for the development team.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Being able to see the big picture allowed me to understand how the pieces of the code were meant to work together and to better understand what needed to be done to accomplish that.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
In the Software Design documentation, the section describing the different operating system options for the various application pieces could have discussed the pros and cons of each OS in more depth.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Ensuring I thoroughly read what the client was asking for was critical to being on the same page as them. If you are not considering what your client wants for the application, then there is no point in building it. Sometimes, clients may ask for things that are not best practices development-wise. Your job is to inform them and guide them to better options, but at the end of the day, all that matters is what the client wants.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I broke down the client's needs and what they wanted to happen in the game and then reverse-engineered it in a sense. They wanted a smooth user experience with images to load quickly and consistently, which led to implementing caching and lazy loading. Taking what the client wants and then walking it backward to figure out what must be done to make it happen is an easy way to ensure you align with the client's goals and depict what will be necessary for the application.
